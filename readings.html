        <h2>As We May Think</h2>
        <h3>Vannevar Bush</h3>
        <p>In the article “As We May Think” by Dr. Vannevar Bush, orginially published in The Atlantic in their July 1945 issue, Bush speculates on the possible futures and frontiers of technology which is focused on the whole of human knowledge, moving past science which has developed only for the sake of war.<br><br>
        A very relevant point that Bush addresses is the overwhelming amount of knowledge on our planet. I think there’s a point in everybody’s life where they come to the realization that they could never truly learn and understand all the information in the world - which increases exponentially everyday - “for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it.”(Bush). But is the indexing of knowledge through technology a solace to this fact? I feel that for many, it isn’t. The fact that all of this data is so easily available to us (as Bush predicted) in actuality makes things more difficult to process. With so much knowledge is at your fingertips, where do you start? Now, what is your excuse to not go through all of it?<br><br>
        Bush’s vision is optimistic, and amazingly accurate, but he fails to predict - or chooses not to mention - that the benefits of new technology are not immune to being controlled by societal systematic powers. Just this past week, on Sunday September 2nd, Brazil’s National Museum was completely consumed by fire. Millions of artifacts and countless amounts of information were lost, many of which were not digitized due to underfunding and severe budget cuts from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Yong).<br><br>
        “As We May Think” is a fascinating read in 2018, comparing Bush’s once very scientific speculations to our population’s common understanding of how technology functions today. We need to continue theorizing where science is going to bring us next, in order to keep pushing forward, but simultaneously realize that access to these advances is still behind locked doors for many.<br><br>

        <h2>How the Atom Bomb Helped Give Birth to the Internet</h2>
        <h3>Johnny Ryan</h3>
        <p>This article adapted from Johnny Ryan's “A History of the Internet and the Digital Future” reviews the historical details and events during the Cold War which lead to the eventual conception of the Internet.<br><br>
        It’s interesting, yet a bit ironic how Bush ties into this article as well. His push towards “cross disciplinary study, openness and a hands-off approach to funded research” (Ryan) after WWII was an important philosophy that guided scientists and organizations into the ultimate creation of the Internet, but at the same time the idea was first sparked by military needs during the Cold War. At the time, Bush thought that technology developed during war could only result in physical tools. But because the Cold War was a political and ideology-driven state of tension, scientific advances had to focus on developing better knowledge and information driven systems.<br><br>
        The history of the invention of the internet shows us that although culture can be changed and modified by new technology, this technology is just as much shaped by the culture that surrounds it. Societal/political/economic desires and needs influence scientific research as much as new inventions influence our everyday lives.<br><br>

        <h2>Writing the History of the Internet</h2>
        <h3>Roy Rosenzweig</h3>
        <p>In the December 1998 journal article, “Wizards, Bureaucrats, Warriors, and Hackers: Writing the History of the Internet”, originally published in The American Historical Review, American historian Roy Rosenzweig examines four different works which provide different historical points of view on the invention of the internet. Rosenzweig evaluates, compares, and contrasts these works based on how the biases of their perspectives — “biographic, bureaucratic, ideologic, and social” (1531) — can fail to accurately represent the true context of how the internet was created.<br><br>
        Rosenzweig’s analysis of these four works is thorough, and by pointing out obvious (and hidden) partialities in each of them while also filling in the gaps left by each work, the essay provides an compelling look into every single one of the elements which affected the emergence of the internet. Through this analysis, Rosenzweig argues that without understanding and considering the full influence and complexities of the social, political, and economic context during the 1960’s and the Cold War, we lose the full story of the invention of the internet.<br><br>
        I think Rosenzweig’s essay is an important piece of writing, not only for it’s clarifications into the mystified history of the internet, but also as a reminder that history is not inherently factual. Much like most other academic practices, history is institutionalized / structured / constructed by those with the power and resources to. There must be a diverse and holistic approach when studying or archiving historical events, otherwise we are prone to misunderstanding how our current situations are affecting us now, and even incorrectly predicting how we need to move forward as a society.<br><br>
